# GitHub Repository Setup

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `alpha-gen`
   - **Description**: `Real-time trading automation system with VWAP/MA9 crossover strategy for 0DTE QQQ options`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/makaminski1337/Developer/alpha-gen

# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alpha-gen.git

# Set the default branch name
git branch -M main

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify the Push

After pushing, you should see:
- All 71 files uploaded to GitHub
- The repository structure matches your local directory
- GitHub Actions will automatically run the CI/CD pipeline

## Step 4: Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" → "Branches"
3. Click "Add rule" for the `main` branch
4. Enable:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB

## Step 5: Create Initial Issues

Create these GitHub issues to track development:

### Issue 1: Real Data Integration
- **Title**: "Integrate real Schwab market data"
- **Description**: "Replace mock data with real Schwab API integration for live trading"
- **Labels**: `enhancement`, `api`

### Issue 2: Production Deployment
- **Title**: "Set up production deployment pipeline"
- **Description**: "Configure Docker deployment and production environment setup"
- **Labels**: `deployment`, `infrastructure`

### Issue 3: Performance Optimization
- **Title**: "Optimize real-time data processing"
- **Description**: "Improve performance for high-frequency market data processing"
- **Labels**: `performance`, `optimization`

## Step 6: Enable GitHub Features

1. **GitHub Actions**: Already configured with CI/CD pipeline
2. **Issues**: Enable for project tracking
3. **Projects**: Create a project board for task management
4. **Wiki**: Optional, for additional documentation
5. **Discussions**: Optional, for community discussions

## Repository Structure Overview

Your repository will contain:
- ✅ **Source Code**: Complete trading automation system
- ✅ **Tests**: Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Setup guides, architecture docs, workflows
- ✅ **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing
- ✅ **Scripts**: Setup, debug, and testing utilities
- ✅ **Configuration**: Environment templates and Git hooks

## Next Steps After Publishing

1. **Clone the repository** on other machines
2. **Set up development environment** using the setup scripts
3. **Configure API keys** for real data integration
4. **Run tests** to verify everything works
5. **Start development** on new features

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Authentication**: Make sure you're logged into GitHub
2. **Repository name**: Ensure the repository name matches exactly
3. **Remote URL**: Double-check the remote URL format
4. **Branch name**: Make sure you're pushing to the correct branch

## Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- ✅ Repository appears on your GitHub profile
- ✅ All files are visible in the web interface
- ✅ GitHub Actions shows a green checkmark
- ✅ You can clone the repository elsewhere
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks work on new commits
