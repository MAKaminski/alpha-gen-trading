- **Integration Tests**: 2 files covering component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: 1 file covering complete trading workflows

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Storage Layer Tests** - Add comprehensive tests for database persistence
2. **App Orchestrator Tests** - Add tests for main application coordination
3. **Trade Generator Tests** - Add tests for signal to trade conversion
4. **Market Data Provider Tests** - Add tests for data ingestion

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Improve Partial Coverage** - Bring OAuth Client, Option Monitor, and Schwab Client to 80%+
2. **Add More Integration Tests** - Cover component interactions
3. **Add Performance Tests** - Ensure system can handle market data load

### Long-term Goals
1. **Property-Based Testing** - Use hypothesis for edge case discovery
2. **Contract Testing** - Ensure API compatibility
3. **Load Testing** - Test under high market data volume
4. **Chaos Testing** - Test system resilience

## Usage

### For Developers
1. Start with `README.md` for project overview
2. Read `docs/role_guide.md` for role-specific guidance
3. Review `docs/TEST_COVERAGE_VISUALIZATION.md` for test coverage details
4. Use `docs/architecture.md` for system design understanding

### For Architects
1. Review `docs/architecture.md` for system overview
2. Examine `docs/test-coverage-architecture.md` for visual test architecture
3. Use `docs/TEST_COVERAGE_VISUALIZATION.md` for detailed coverage analysis
4. Check `docs/AGENT.md` for requirements and constraints

### For Project Managers
1. Review `docs/AGENT.md` for project status and priorities
2. Use `docs/TEST_COVERAGE_VISUALIZATION.md` for quality metrics
3. Check `docs/test-coverage-architecture.md` for development timeline

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated whenever:
- Test coverage changes significantly
- New components are added
- Architecture changes
- Requirements are modified
- New test types are introduced

The documentation is designed to be self-maintaining through the CI/CD pipeline, which automatically updates coverage metrics and generates reports.
